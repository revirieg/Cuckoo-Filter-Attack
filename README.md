# Cuckoo-Filter-Attack

## Description

This script executes an attack to a cuckoo filter in Redis as described in this paper:
P. Reviriego and D. Larrabeiti, “Denial of Service Attack on Cuckoo Filter based Networking Systems”, in IEEE Communications Letters (in press).

For the script to work, cuckoo filter expansion has to be disabled in RedisBloom.
